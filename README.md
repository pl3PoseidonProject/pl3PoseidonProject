### Hello We are Team Poseidon, We are planning to create an app that both connects doctor and their patients. The doctor will set the notification settings of the users phone through an app when they will take their medicines and when their next checkup will be. They will also send a notification of what are the kinds of medicine needed for their patients to take.
